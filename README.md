# work-automation

This project is designed to automate work tasks on a schedule. The current tasks I have automated are..

1. CEM Scores PDF Downloader - This pulls our customer service scores and obtains useful data from the pdf files.

2. Catering PDF Downloader - This pulls our catering orders for the next business date and pulls useful data from the pdf.

3. Groupme Message - This will take in a message as a parameter and will send it out to a selected Groupme account.
